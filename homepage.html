        <h4>MORE ABOUT NATURE</h4>
        <p>

          Earth’s natural resources include air, water, soil, minerals, fuels, plants, and animals. <br>
             Conservation is the practice of caring for these resources so all living things can benefit from them now and in the future.
All the things we need to survive, such as food, water, air, and shelter, come from natural resources. <br>
 Some of these resources, like small plants, can be replaced quickly after they are used. Others, like large trees, take a long time to replace. These are renewable resources.
Other resources, such as fossil fuels, cannot be replaced at all. Once they are used up, they are gone <br>
forever. These are nonrenewable resources. <br>
People often waste natural resources. Animals are overhunted. Forests are cleared, exposing land to <br>
 wind and water damage. Fertile soil is exhausted and lost to erosion because of poor farming practices. <br>
  Fuel supplies are depleted. Water and air are polluted. <br>
If resources are carelessly managed, many will be used up. If used wisely and efficiently, however, <br>
 renewable resources will last much longer. Through conservation, people can reduce waste and manage natural resources wisely.
The population of human beings has grown enormously in the past two centuries. Billions of people use <br>
up resources quickly as they eat food, build houses, produce goods, and burn fuel for transportation <br>
and electricity. The continuation of life as we know it depends on the careful use of natural resources.
The need to conserve resources often conflicts with other needs. For some people, a wooded area may be <br>
a good place to put a farm. A timber company may want to harvest the area’s trees for construction materials. A business may want to build a factory or shopping mall on the land.
